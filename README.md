# pytwb: A workbench for creating ROS applications based on py_trees and py_trees_ros frameworks (beta).
pytwb is assumed to be used with VSCode under docker environment. It generates and runs ROS packages on a command line basis. Although based on py_trees, it is possible to define behavior trees using XML, because pytwb is equipped with the XML parser.  With just writing XML and Python codes by VSCode, it becomes possible to execute them interactively as a ROS application.

## Getting Started
### Prerequirement
pytwb is a normal Python application and can be installed locally, but it is recommended to use docker to build ROS applications and create an execution environment by using pytwb. Development is done by first generating a docker under the control of VSCode. Therefore, the docker environment and VSCode must be available for the Ubuntu-22 environment. It's standard to do the development in WSL. VSCode must have a plugin installed for docker.

### Installation
The entire installation process is managed by VSCode and you don't need to build explicitly.
First, you need to retrieve the pytwb module.

```
git clone https://github.com/momoiorg-repository/pytwb.git
cd pytwb
```
(at "pytwb" directory)  
start VSCode by "code ."
Select docker-compose.yaml
press “F1”  
 -> select “Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container” tab  
![Open Folder in Container](doc/resource/VSCode1.jpg)  
 -> select current directory as work directory  
 -> select “From ‘docker-compose.yaml’  
![Open Folder in Container](doc/resource/VSCode2.jpg)  
the corresponding docker will be started and VSCode is attached automatically.  
Set working directory of VSCode by its "Open Folder" menu to “/root/pytwb_wb”.  
input “export DISPLAY= xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:0.0” from the Terminal section.  
Install VSCode "Python in Dev Container" plugin.  
Select “main.py” and press F5.  
The “> “ prompt will be displayed in the Terminal section.   This implies that pytwb command session has been started successfully.  
By inputting “create sample” command to it, The “sample” package will be created.

### Coding and running
You need to input behavior code in Python and behavior tree code in XML by using VSCode.    
First, create the behavior code in Python under  
```
 /root/pytwb_wb/src/sample/sample/behavior  
```
and create the XML code of the behavior tree under  
```
/root/pytwb_wb/src/sample/sample/trees
```

When all codes are completed, input “run \<tree name\>” from the pytwb command session and the behavior tree based application will get running under the VSCode debug mode.
The \<tree name\> is the file name of the XML behavior tree you created under the 'trees' directory, or it without the '.XML'.

You can set break points to any locations of the Python code you created.

When you need external program modules, you can execute apt and pip3 commands from the pytwb prompt.  The installation of these modules will be recorded and reflected to Dockerfile template automatically.  The template will be generated by “dockerfile” command, and the _Dokerfile file will be placed at right under the pytwb_wb directory as the Dockerfile draft.

Finally, the package is completed by building a ROS package with  
\<package name\>/\<package name\>/main.py  
as the main.
