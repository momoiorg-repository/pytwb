# pytwb: A workbench for creating ROS applications based on py_trees and py_trees_ros frameworks.
pytwb is assumed to be used with VSCode under docker environment. It generates and runs ROS packages on a command line basis. Although based on py_trees, it is possible to define behavior trees using XML, because pytwb is equipped with the XML parser.  With just writing XML and Python codes by VSCode, it becomes possible to execute them interactively as a ROS application.

## Usage
This repository is for pytwb development. For those who want to use pytwb, please switch to [pytwb_tutorial](https://github.com/momoiorg-repository/pytwb_tutorial).
